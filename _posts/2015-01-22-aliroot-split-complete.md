title: AliRoot split complete!
createtoc: true
---

The AliRoot split has been finally completed on schedule (despite a glitch on
the Git services that was not under our control).

This means that there are now two repositories available:

 * [AliRoot Core](https://git.cern.ch/web/AliRoot.git)
 * [AliPhysics](https://git.cern.ch/web/AliPhysics.git)

and LEGO trains are operational again.

Have a look at the [updated installation instructions](/alice/install-aliroot).

Some minor glitches are expected, please contact support for any problem.

> There is a new variable called `ALICE_PHYSICS`:
> [start using it!](/2015/01/14/aliroot-split/#migrate_now_to_alice_physics!)
